# Mini Hero Game
Made with Unity

In this game you play as a Super-Hero of your own making.
You choose the aperance. You then pick a primary and secondary power for them and unlock abilities from those powers.
For example, if you choose energy powers as you primary, you unlock abilities from among four dirernt energy baset poweres, from a beam that hits enemies from a far
to a burst that hits all enemies near you, and more!
There are over a dozen abilities currenlt in the game and more in development.

Once you have made your character, you explore levels, defeat enemies and collect xp to gain unlock-Points which can be used to unlock and upgrade new abilites.
At the moment here are very few levels and enemy types, but I have plans to add more soon.
